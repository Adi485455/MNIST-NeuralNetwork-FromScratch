# MNIST-NeuralNetwork-FromScratch
Built a neural network from scratch in Python using NumPy to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Implemented forward/backward propagation and gradient descent manually, achieving ~85% accuracy. Demonstrates understanding of neural network fundamentals and training process.
